# 🤖 PHOTON_MICRO_LLM_BOOTSTRAPPING.md

## 🧠 Objective

Leverage existing OpenAPI specs + GPT-4 to generate high-quality instruction-tuning data for Photon’s micro LLM — without hand-curating thousands of examples.

---

## 🔁 Bootstrapping Flow

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1.   | Scrape public OpenAPI specs from GitHub/API directories |
| 2.   | Parse paths + schemas via `openapiv3` Rust crate |
| 3.   | Prompt GPT-4: “Describe this path in natural language” |
| 4.   | Store: `{ "instruction": "...", "output": <OpenAPI fragment> }` |
| 5.   | Curate + dedupe | Optional review round |
| 6.   | Use for LoRA fine-tuning |

## 📘 Example Prompt

> Instruction: “Describe this OpenAPI path in natural language.”
```json
{
  "path": "/users",
  "method": "get",
  "responses": {
    "200": {
      "content": {
        "application/json": {
          "schema": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": { "$ref": "#/components/schemas/User" }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> GPT-4 Response:
> “Create a GET /users endpoint that returns a list of user objects.”

## 🧰 Rust CLI Bootstrapper

- `photon-ai-bootstrap` tool:
    - Reads `openapi.yaml`
    - Extracts path operations
    - POSTs prompts to GPT-4 via `async-openai`
    - Serializes `.jsonl` output into training corpus

---

## 🔁 Self-Improving Dataset Strategy

- Train v0.1 → fine-tune → use it to self-generate more prompts
- Human review layer for top-quality canonical tasks
- Gradual dataset expansion

---

## 🚀 Advantages

- Fast bootstrapping
- High-quality structured examples
- Tuned specifically to Photon + OpenAPI CLI use
