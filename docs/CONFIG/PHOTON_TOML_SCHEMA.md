## ðŸ§­ Purpose

- Acts as a single source of config truth for:
  - CLI commands
  - Engine behavior (codegen, validation, runtime)
  - SaaS service expectations
  - Local development/devtools
- Keeps the project portable and automation-friendly

---

## ðŸ§© Integration Points

- `photon dev` reads paths and watch config
- `photon build` uses deploy config
- `photon ai` uses model/provider config
- `photon generate` obeys `codegen.output_mode`
- SaaS dashboard could parse and sync with it

---

Add to `docs/CONFIG/PHOTON_TOML_SCHEMA.md` and track schema in `photon-engine` and CLI?
