### üì¶ Build Hook Spec

| Phase     | Description                                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `pre`     | Runs before any build step. Ideal for env setup, schema sync, cleanup |
| `post`    | Runs after both frontend and backend build complete. Useful for notifications, artifacts, tagging |

---

### üîß CLI Behavior

- Hooks executed in declared order via shell (`sh -c`)
- All commands run in project root
- `--skip-hooks` disables both
- Fail-fast on any non-zero exit

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Edge Features

- `PHOTON_ENV` environment var available in hook scope
- Supports `.sh`, `.ts`, `.js`, or shell inline strings
- Hooks may mutate output dir, push tags, etc.
